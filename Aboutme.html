    <h2> My Inroduction </h2>
    <p> I am very interested in learning new languages. 
        I speak four: English, Spanish, Portuguese and French and am currently working on learning Italian and Arabic.
        I am a big fan of traveling and have been to over 20 countries. 
        Some highlights include Machu Picchu, the Great Wall of China, and the Taj Mahal.

    <h2> Maharshi </h2>
    <p>
        'Maharshi' has been touted to be a journey of Rishi Kumar.  It's one and that's one big issue with the movie.  
        In his journey, the hero keeps on visiting and revisiting the definition of success multiple times.  
        Every time he meets his mother (Jayasudha), they talk in the language of wannabe motivational gurus brainstorming on their syllabus. 
         "Success is... commas... full-stops," Mahesh Babu says again and again at regular intervals.  
        He should have added a couple of punctuation marks (like semi-colon, hyphen) at least in the second half.
